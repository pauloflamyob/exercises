# Binary Search Tree

A binary tree is a tree which is characterized by any of the following properties:

It can be empty (null).

It can contain a root node which contain some value and two subtree, left subtree and right subtree, which are also binary tree.

A binary tree is a binary search tree (BST) if all the non-empty nodes follows both two properties:

If node has a left subtree, then all the values in its left subtree are smaller than the value of the current node.

If node has a right subtree, then all the value in its right subtree are greater than the value of the current node.

You are given N nodes, each having unique value ranging from [1, N], how many different binary search tree can be created using all of them?

### Input 
First line will contain an integer, T, number of test cases. 

Then T lines follow, where each line represent a test case.

Each test case consists a single integer, N, where N is the number of nodes in the binary search tree.

### Output 
For each test case, find the number of different binary search trees that can be created using these nodes.

Print the answer modulo `(108+7)`.

### Constraints
```
1 <= T <= 1000 
1 <= N <= 1000
```

### Sample Input
```

100
```

### Sample Output
```

25666077
```
### Explanation
 
Test Case #1: We have only one tree.

```
1
```

Test Case #2: Two trees can be created using two nodes.

```
1          2
 \        /
  2      1
```

Test Case #3:
```
1          1         2         3        3
 \          \       / \       /        /
  2          3     1   3     1        2
   \        /                 \      /
    3      2                   2    1
```
